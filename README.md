# How about SpartanHost? SpartanHost Introduction and Review

## SpartanHost Introduction

SpartanHost offers AMD VPS in Seattle with restocked inventory and a 20% discount using the code KVM20. For annual payments, an additional 20% discount applies. SpartanHost VPS features AMD Ryzen 5950X processors, NVMe storage, 10Gbps bandwidth, and 20G DDoS protection. The lowest configuration has been discontinued, so current lower-tier plans are the new entry-level offerings.
